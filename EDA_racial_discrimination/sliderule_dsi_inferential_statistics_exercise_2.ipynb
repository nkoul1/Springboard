    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",

    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "There is concern that racial discrimination is preventing people of color from recieving work. To determine whether or not there were differences in the number of black applicants recieving interviews versus the number of white applicants recieving interviews we performed a two sample hypothesis test. For our null hypothesis, we assumed that there was no difference between the the proportion of applicants that were accepted between the black and white groups. Our resulting p-value from this test was practically 0. This means that our null hypothesis must be rejected and that there is some difference between the proportion of people being called back for interviews between the black and white data sets. However this does not necessarily mean that racial discrimination is the casue of this discrepency. Our test was to simply see if there was a difference between the two groups, not what the cause of the difference was. Since there are many more factors in play it is not possible to determine the significance of race with this test alone. To truly understand the affect of racial discrimination on the call back process we would need to control for experience, education, and age among other things. This could be accomplished by sending out resumes that are practically identical outside of race.\n",
